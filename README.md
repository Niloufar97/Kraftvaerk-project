# React + Vite

During our project period with Kraftvaerk, our team took on the challenge of 
transitioning a key element of Kraftvaerk's website. The organization currently operates 
with an Angular-based website and expressed the desire to migrate to React.js. Our 
assigned task involved laying the groundwork for this transition by focusing on the 
basics, specifically crafting the SST (Standard Smoke Tests) page. This project allowed 
us to delve into the intricacies of React.js and contribute to the initial stages of 
Kraftvaerk's migration journey.
Here are the pictures of the final product:
